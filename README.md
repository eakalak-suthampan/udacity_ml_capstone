## WSDM - KKBox's Churn Prediction Challenge
Can you predict when subscribers will churn?

## Project Overview
This capstone will take the problem from the Kaggle competition ["WSDM - KKBox's Churn Prediction Challenge"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kkbox-churn-prediction-challenge). The KKBOX is Asia’s leading music streaming service and would like to build an algorithm that predicts whether a user will churn after their subscription expires. Currently, the company uses survival analysis techniques to determine the residual membership life time for each subscriber. By adopting different methods, KKBOX anticipates they’ll discover new insights to why users leave so they can be proactive in keeping users dancing.
